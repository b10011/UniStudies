# UniStudies
Website to help with scheduling tasks and deadlines (weekly homework, lectures, exams, project works etc)

# Current state
This is currently only prototype to test and feel the design of the UI and database!

# Upcoming
I'm planning to write the backend of the project with Nodejs/React + MongoDB as soon as I have time for that. Also I'm planning to add option to share course data with other students so that they can just use the template you uploaded.
